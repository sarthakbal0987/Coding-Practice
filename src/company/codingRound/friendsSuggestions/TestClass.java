* Question Given by Rahul's Friend(Coding Round)
* ------------------**********---------------------
*
* Problem statement:
* ------------------
* You are playing an online game. In the game, a list of N numbers is given.
*
* The player has to arrange the numbers so that all the odd numbers of the list
* come after the even numbers.
*
* Write an algorithm to arrange the given list such that all the odd numbers
* of the list come after the even numbers.
*
* Input tofu
* ------
* The first line of the input consists of an integer num.representing
* the size of the list(N).
*
* The second line of the input consists of
* N  space-separated  integers representing the values of the list
*
* Output
* -------
* Print N space-separated integers such that all the odd numbers of the list
* come after the even numbers
*
* Example
*
* Sample Input
* -------------
* 8
* 10 98 12 3 33 22 21 11
* Sample Output
* --------------
* 10 98 12 22 3 33 21 11
